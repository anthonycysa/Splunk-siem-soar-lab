üéØ MITRE ATT&CK Mapping ‚Äì Splunk SIEM + SOAR Lab

This document maps the detection use cases implemented in this lab to the MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ framework, a globally recognized model of adversarial behavior used by SOC teams for threat detection and response.

## üß† Technique Mappings

| Use Case                     | Technique ID | Technique Name                          | Data Source                     | Description |
|-----------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force Login Attempts  | T1110.001    | Credential Access: Password Guessing    | Windows Security Logs (4625)     | Detected by monitoring excessive login failures from the same source IP or user account |
| Suspicious PowerShell Usage | T1059.001    | Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell | ScriptBlockLogging, Sysmon      | Flagged based on presence of encoded commands, suspicious switches (`-nop`, `-enc`) |
| DNS Tunneling Activity      | T1071.004    | Application Layer Protocol: DNS         | DNS Logs                         | Alert triggered by high-frequency TXT queries and domain entropy indicating possible tunneling |
| Process Injection Detection | T1055        | Defense Evasion: Process Injection       | Sysmon Event ID 8                | Monitored anomalous process behavior like explorer.exe spawning cmd.exe or rundll32.dll |
| Remote Command Execution    | T1053.005    | Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task       | Windows Task Scheduler logs      | Detection based on unusual or unauthorized scheduled tasks being created or modified |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool-to-Technique Mapping

| Splunk Component             | MITRE Use Case                 | Technique ID | Comments |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|----------|
| Windows Security Log Alerts | Brute Force                    | T1110.001    | Based on 4625 event ID patterns |
| Sysmon Log Correlation      | PowerShell + Process Injection | T1059.001 / T1055 | Sysmon Event IDs 1, 8 |
| DNS Log Analysis            | Tunneling                      | T1071.004    | Domain entropy and TXT request spikes |
| SOAR Automation             | Response to Detected Behaviors | -            | Maps to NIST ‚ÄúRespond‚Äù functions, acts after MITRE TTPs are detected |
